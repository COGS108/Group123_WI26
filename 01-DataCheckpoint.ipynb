    "AI has the potential to improve a wide range of fields and these industries may vary depending on the country. For example, in Kenya, AI is utilized to analyze the soil and crop conditions in agriculture.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) On the other hand, the healthcare industry in South Africa utilizes AI to better understand and meet patient needs.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) AI powered tools have substantially reduced human errors in such fields which require precise calculations, leading to a rapid development of new technology, thus enhancing a country’s economic growth.

    "Hypothesis: Country economic development will predict a dual pattern in ChatGPT usage: higher-income countries will show both greater usage frequency and higher allocation to learning support (tutoring/explanations/summaries), while lower-income countries will show lower frequency but proportionally more assignment production (drafting/writing/coding/generating deliverables).\n",

    "Explanation:We predict that higher-education students in more economically developed countries will report using ChatGPT more often for schoolwork. We also predict that, among users, students in less developed countries will use ChatGPT relatively more for assignment production (drafting/writing/coding), while students in more developed countries will use it relatively more for learning support (tutoring/explanations/summaries). We expect this pattern because access and adoption tend to be higher in wealthier countries, while higher academic pressure and fewer support resources may push students in lower-income settings toward using ChatGPT to generate deliverables, and stricter academic integrity norms in some higher-income settings may discourage production-style use.\n"

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "  - Dataset Name: Higher Education Students’ Evolving Perceptions of ChatGPT: Global Survey Data from the Academic Year 2024–2025\n",
    "  - Link to the dataset: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/nv2343nwsb/2\n",
    "  - Number of observations: 22,963 students from 120 countries/territories\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 175\n",
    "  - The variables most relevant to our project is the self-reported frequency of students using ChatGPT for the tasks listed in Q18. The sub-questions in Q18 can be grouped into three categories: assignment production, learning support, and both. Since the responses in the dataset have already converted into numbers corresponding to the rating scale from “Never” to “Always,” the average score of each category will be utilized to compare the frequency of using ChatGPT for learning support versus assignment production.\n",
    "      - Assignment production\n",

    "  - Similar to dataset #1, the survey results are entirely based on the student's perception and interpretation of the questionnaire, increasing the likelihood of dishonest responses and misunderstandings. With respect to the project, the data excludes underlying specific reasons why a student would use ChatGPT to complete those tasks, such as whether one uses it for the convenience, or due to the competitiveness of their academic environment, which potentially ties to the economic development of a country. Furthermore, this dataset lacks reports on the students’ financial circumstances. Therefore, we also need to incorporate datasets that display the economic development of the countries reported by the students in order to get a clearer visualization that can answer our questions."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "People who took the survey took it knowingly. One concern is that they might not have known their data would be used in our project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    " Survey takers took it willingly so there may be response bias in the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " Anonymizing and identifiable information\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    " By using data from multiple countries and territories, we are able to get a diverse range of data and survey takers. We also take into consideration their own perceptions rather than others perceptions of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    " We will anonymize any sensitive data that may directly or indirectly reveal the identity of any individuals, including device identifiers, names, addresses, etc. If the dataset is leaked, those who took the survey may be at risk of exposing confidential information to unauthorized organizations and individuals, thus at risk for identity theft and doxxing and such.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    " The individual can contact us through email or other stated contact to request the removal of their personal information. Their personal information may be required to prove themselves as the owner of the data they wish to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    " After the data has been used for its original purpose, it should be deleted unless it has been explicitly stated at the beginning of data collection and the individual is notified explicitly. This helps prevent the risk of data breaches and leak of personal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing the data, it’s important to consider both direct and indirect factors that could affect how students use ChatGPT. While a country’s level of economic development is the main focus, other variables like field of study, language background, and access to technology could influence ChatGPT usage at the same time. If these factors are ignored, the results could be misleading. Including them helps reduce confounding and makes the findings more applicable across different student groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is also checked for potential bias. Since the data are self-reported, the same students may not report their ChatGPT usage accurately, either because they are unsure how to categorize their use or because they are worried about academic consequences. Some countries may also have fewer responses than others, which could skew the comparisons. These issues are addressed by checking for imbalance groups, avoiding strong conclusions from small samples, and being transparent about uncertainty in the results. Visualizations and summary statistics are kept simple and clearly labeled so the data are not exaggerated or misrepresented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Student privacy is protected throughout the analysis by not collecting or displaying any personally identifiable information. All results are reported at an aggregate level, and no individual student responses are singled out. Finally, the analysis process is documented step by step, including how variables are created and how decisions are made, so the work can be reviewed or repeated later if problems are found. This helps keep the analysis transparent and accountable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this project studies differences in how students across countries use ChatGPT, it is important to make sure that the model does not rely on variables that unfairly discriminate against certain groups or act as proxies for sensitive characteristics. Country-level economic indicators are necessary for the analysis, but they are only used to describe broader context, not to make judgments about individual students. The model avoids using variables that could indirectly stand in for sensitive characteristics, and we check relationships between variables to make sure none of them function as unfair proxies. To make sure the model behaves reasonably across different groups, results are compared for students from different income-level countries, academic fields, and language backgrounds to see whether error patterns differ in meaningful ways. Instead of relying on a single performance metric, we look at multiple measures so that overall accuracy does not hide uneven performance across groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also prioritize models that are easy to interpret, which makes it possible to explain in simple terms how economic development relates to both the frequency and type of ChatGPT use. Throughout the analysis, we clearly acknowledge limitations such as self-reported data, possible sampling bias, and the fact that the results show associations rather than casual relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this project is mainly academic, the findings could still be misused if they are taken out of context. For example, country-level trends might be used to make assumptions about individual students or to justify unequal treatment, which is not what the data support. To reduce this risk, the results should be reviewed periodically, especially if ChatGPT usage patterns change over time or if new data are added. If harm or misuse is identified, the analysis should be revisited and, if necessary, revised or withdrawn. Since the model is not meant for automated or high-stakes decisions, rolling it back would simply involve stopping its use or removing it from any downstream applications. Being clear about appropriate and inappropriate uses of the results, and monitoring how they are shared or interpreted, is essential to preventing unintended harm.\n"

    "Hypothesis: Country economic development will predict a dual pattern in ChatGPT usage: higher-income countries will show both greater usage frequency and higher allocation to learning support (tutoring/explanations/summaries), while lower-income countries will show lower frequency but proportionally more assignment production (drafting/writing/coding/generating deliverables).\n",

    "\n",

    "Explanation:We predict that higher-education students in more economically developed countries will report using ChatGPT more often for schoolwork. We also predict that, among users, students in less developed countries will use ChatGPT relatively more for assignment production (drafting/writing/coding), while students in more developed countries will use it relatively more for learning support (tutoring/explanations/summaries). We expect this pattern because access and adoption tend to be higher in wealthier countries, while higher academic pressure and fewer support resources may push students in lower-income settings toward using ChatGPT to generate deliverables, and stricter academic integrity norms in some higher-income settings may discourage production-style use.\n"

    "At the country level, the dataset would include measures of economic development such as GDP per capita, World Bank income classification, and internet access rates. These indicators would be used to represent a country’s level of economic development and would be merged with student responses using standardized country codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the student level, the dataset would collect basic demographic and academic information, including age, level of study, field of study, primary language, and self-reported English proficiency, which are important for controlling differences in access to and reliance on ChatGPT. The dataset would also include detailed measures of ChatGPT usage for schoolwork. This would include how frequently students use ChatGPT, measured on a scale ranging from never to daily use, as well as questions about how they primarily use it. Students would report whether they mainly use ChatGPT for learning support (such as explaining concepts, summarizing readings, or studying) or for assignment production (such as drafting essays, writing code, or generating deliverables). Ideally, data would be collected from several thousand higher-education students across multiple countries through an anonymous online survey distributed via universities and student organizations. \n",

    "Hypothesis: Country economic development will predict a dual pattern in ChatGPT usage: higher-income countries will show both greater usage frequency and higher allocation to learning support (tutoring/explanations/summaries), while lower-income countries will show lower frequency but proportionally more assignment production (drafting/writing/coding/generating deliverables).\n",

    "Explanation:We predict that higher-education students in more economically developed countries will report using ChatGPT more often for schoolwork. We also predict that, among users, students in less developed countries will use ChatGPT relatively more for assignment production (drafting/writing/coding), while students in more developed countries will use it relatively more for learning support (tutoring/explanations/summaries). We expect this pattern because access and adoption tend to be higher in wealthier countries, while higher academic pressure and fewer support resources may push students in lower-income settings toward using ChatGPT to generate deliverables, and stricter academic integrity norms in some higher-income settings may discourage production-style use.\n"
